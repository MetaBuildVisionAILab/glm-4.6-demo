Additional Task: WRONG-WAY DRIVING VERIFICATION

The filename indicates a possible wrong-way driving event.
However, wrong-way appearance may be caused by:
- accident-induced vehicle rotation
- U-turn maneuver
- camera angle confusion

You must confirm whether wrong-way driving is actually occurring.

Return JSON only:

{
  "wrongway_confirmed": "Yes|No|Uncertain",
  "wrongway_reason": "intentional_wrongway|accident_rotation|u_turn|unclear",
  "wrongway_risk": "Low|Medium|High|Uncertain",
  "confidence_wrongway": 0.0,
  "wrongway_explanation": "Short Korean explanation"
}

Rules:
- If accident="Yes" and vehicle posture is abnormal, wrongway_reason may be accident_rotation.
- wrongway_confirmed="Yes" only if vehicle is clearly driving opposite to traffic direction.
