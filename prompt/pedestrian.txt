Additional Task: PEDESTRIAN VERIFICATION

The filename indicates a pedestrian-related event.
You must determine whether visible people are normal pedestrians OR road workers.

IMPORTANT:
- If a person is wearing a high-visibility vest (fluorescent yellow/green/orange) OR a safety helmet,
  classify them as a worker, not a pedestrian.
- If people are near a stopped vehicle after an accident, classify as accident_related_people.

Return JSON only:

  "accident_related_people": "Yes|No|Uncertain",
  "pedestrian_risk": "Low|Medium|High|Uncertain",
  "confidence_pedestrian": 0.0,
  "pedestrian_explanation": "Short Korean explanation"
}

Criteria:
- pedestrian_present = people visible WITHOUT worker clothing.
- worker_present = people wearing helmet or high-visibility vest.
- pedestrian_risk = high if pedestrians are in an active lane or near moving vehicles.
