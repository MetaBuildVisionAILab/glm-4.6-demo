Additional Task: STOP EVENT VERIFICATION

The filename indicates this may be a STOP event video.
However, stopping may be caused by normal traffic OR by an accident.

You must verify whether the stop is abnormal and determine the stop type.

Rules:
- If accident="Yes" from system analysis, classify stop as accident_related_stop.
- If accident="No", classify stop as normal_stop or suspicious_stop.
- If stop is caused by red light or congestion across all lanes, it is normal_stop.
- If only one vehicle stops abnormally in a lane or intersection, it is suspicious_stop.

Return JSON only:

  "stop_location_detail": "shoulder|middle_lane|intersection|crosswalk|roadside|unknown",
